Hello

The exhibition featured 3,098 paintings , 33 three dimensional works and 2,012 calligraphy works selected from 374 elementary and junior high schools in Nagoya City , along with works by children from sister cities and friendship cities .
As many as 25078 people with visitors .
The unique works by the children of sister cities and friendship cities were different from the works by the children of Nagoya City in terms of the use of colors and the overflowing atmosphere from the screens . Many parents and children were seen looking at the works with interest while thinking about the state of each sister city and friendship city .
So I am very late , but I would like to send you a postcard as a memento that shows the works that children in Nagoya city submitted to this exhibition and the works selected from the works sent from sister cities and friendship cities in this city . I hope you find it useful .
This year , as part of the Sister and Friendship City Project , the 43rd Sister Friendship City Children and Students Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition will be held from November 17 to 21 , 2021 . We are planning to exhibit works received from each city that is a sister and friendship city of this city .
Therefore , we would like to ask you to send us the works of children in your city ( 50 flat works such as paintings , 54 cm x 39 cm or less ) by September 1 , 2021 if possible .
At the same time , please include a list of names of authors , ages , and titles of each work .
I will send you the form made in Excel attached to the email , so please send it back to me by the attached email after you input it .
Please note that we will not return the works you sent to us , just like other sister cities and friendship cities , as we will use them as educational materials in this city after the exhibition ends .
At this time next year , we will be sending the works of children from Nagoya to your city from this city , so we hope you will find them useful .
We believe that it is appropriate for the purpose of promoting mutual understanding and deepening friendship between the two cities that the works of children sent from sister cities and friendship cities are widely appreciated by citizens .
We look forward to your continued cooperation in the future .
Sincerely yours

In addition to the " Special Needs Education Enrollment Incentive Fund " , there is a " School Expense Subsidy " program that provides financial support for school lunch fees and paying for necessary school supplies for those who are in financial trouble .
You ca n't receive the same payment items of the School Expense Subsidy and the Special Needs Education Enrollment Promotion Fund at the same time .
The school expense subsidy is more generous , so I recommend that those who are eligible for the school expense subsidy choose the school expense subsidy .
However , you need to apply for the transportation expenses for exchange study because they are paid only by the special needs education enrollment promotion allowance .

Deduction
A single parent who is not eligible for widow / Widower s Deduction shall be deemed to be eligible for widow / Widower s Deduction ( limited to a rearer or a person responsible for support ) .
* 1 If the recipient is the mother , Special Deduction for Widows and Widow s Deduction are not applicable .
* 2 If the beneficiary is the father , the Widower s Deduction will not be applied .
< Example > Annual income of 2 million yen , child support of 400000 yen received by the recipient , child support of 100,000 yen received by the subject child , three children , three dependents under the tax law , and no person responsible for support .
The full payment will be less than 1.63 million yen , the partial payment will be less than 3.06 million yen , and the full payment will be stopped if it s more than 3.06 million yen .
Since 80 % of Child Rearing Expenses is added to the income , 2 million yen + ( 400000 yen + 100,000 yen ) x 0.8 = 2.4 million yen .
Subtracting the amount of deduction from this , 2.4 million yen - 80000 yen ( fixed amount deduction ) = 2.32 million yen , which corresponds to  partial payment  .
The monthly allowance for the first child is 43,150 yen - ( 2.32 million yen ( income ) - 1.63 million yen ) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen .
10,180 yen - ( 2.32 million yen ( income ) - 1.63 million yen ) √ó 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen for the second child
6,100 yen - ( 2.32 million yen ( income ) - 1.63 million yen ) √ó 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen for the third child
It is 39,600 yen in total .
