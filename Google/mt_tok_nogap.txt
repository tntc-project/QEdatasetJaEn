Full payment is less than 1.63 million yen , partial payment is less than 3.06 million yen , and full payment is suspended for 3.06 million yen or more .
80 % of child support will be added to income , so 2 million yen + ( 400,000 yen + 100,000 yen ) x 0.8 = 2.4 million yen .

The monthly allowance for the first person is 43,150 yen - ( 2,320,000 yen ( income ) - 1,630,000 yen ) x 0.0230559 = 27,240 yen
The second person is 10,180 yen - ( 2,320,000 yen ( income ) - 1,630,000 yen ) x 0.0035524 = 7,730 yen
The third person is 6,100 yen - ( 2,320,000 yen ( income ) - 1,630,000 yen ) x 0.0021259 = 4,630 yen
The total is 39,600 yen .
